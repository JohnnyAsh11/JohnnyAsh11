### Hello, World!
I'm Johnny Fagerlin!

I am an aspiring Simulations Engineer/Graphics Developer with skills in Software Development and an enduring passion for architecting and developing complex programs within a graphical environment.  Implementing physics and working with cameras are some of my favorite systems to develop.  I am best in C/C#/C++, though I am also fluent in JavaScript.  Take a look into my projects to learn more about how I program!  My most recent projects are AshEngine and PrimroseEngine.
